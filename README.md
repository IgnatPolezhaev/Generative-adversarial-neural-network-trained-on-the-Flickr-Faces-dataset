# Generative-adversarial-neural-network-trained-on-the-Flickr-Faces-dataset
This work was done on the basis of a PyTorch [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html). The generative adversarial neural network was trained on the Flickr Faces [Flickr Faces](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) dataset.
